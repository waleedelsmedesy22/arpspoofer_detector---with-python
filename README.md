# ARP Spoofer Detector (Python) — Lab Project

## Overview
This repository is a **template** for an ARP spoofing detection tool intended **only for educational and defensive use** in a controlled lab environment.  
It contains documentation and supporting files — **no attack or exploit code is included**.

An ARP spoofing detector monitors ARP traffic and alerts when suspicious changes (e.g., duplicate IP/MAC bindings) occur.  
This project is designed strictly for **isolated lab networks** or defensive research where you have explicit permission.

---

## ⚠️ Legal & Safety Notice
Monitoring networks you do **not** own or lack explicit permission to inspect may violate privacy laws.  
This repository deliberately omits any malicious code.  
Use it only for defensive or research purposes in environments where you have authorization.

---

## What this repo provides
- Structured README and documentation.
- `requirements.txt` listing common Python libraries for packet analysis in a lab.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) for open educational use.
- `arp_spoofer_detector.py.example` — a placeholder file (no runnable code) for your own lab implementation.

---

## Suggested Lab Features
*(Conceptual only — not implemented here)*  
- Listen for ARP replies and build a mapping of IP ↔ MAC addresses.  
- Detect anomalies such as multiple MACs for one IP.  
- Log alerts to a file or console.  
- Optional email or Slack notifications (in lab only).

---

## Requirements (for lab experimentation)
If you later add your own defensive code, these Python packages are commonly used:
- scapy
- pyshark
- dpkt

See `requirements.txt` for pinned versions.

---

## Usage (High-level, non-actionable)
1. Prepare an isolated lab network or obtain explicit permission from the network owner.
2. Add your own monitoring/detection logic inside `arp_spoofer_detector.py.example`.
3. Document results and findings.
